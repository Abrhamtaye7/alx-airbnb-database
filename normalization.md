Normalization Review for AirBnB Database SchemaThe objective of this review is to ensure the database schema, based on the provided entity-relationship (ER) specifications, adheres to the principles of Third Normal Form (3NF).1. Review of Normal FormsThe database schema, which includes the entities User, Property, Booking, Payment, Review, and Message, was analyzed against the first three normal forms.Normal Form (NF)RequirementStatusRationale1NF (First Normal Form)No repeating groups or arrays. All attribute values must be atomic.PASSAll attributes (e.g., first_name, email, price_per_night) hold a single, atomic value. Repeating groups are not present.2NF (Second Normal Form)Must be in 1NF. No non-prime attribute (non-PK) is dependent on only a part of a composite primary key.PASSNone of the tables use a composite primary key. All non-key attributes are fully dependent on the entire primary key (user_id, property_id, booking_id, etc.).3NF (Third Normal Form)Must be in 2NF. No non-prime attribute is transitively dependent on the primary key (i.e., no non-key attribute depends on another non-key attribute).PASSEach non-key column in every table is directly dependent on the table's primary key and not on any other non-key column.2. Detailed 3NF Compliance AnalysisTo confirm 3NF compliance, we examine each table for transitive dependencies (where $A \rightarrow B$ and $B \rightarrow C$, implying $A \rightarrow C$ is an indirect dependency).A. User TableAttributes: user_id (PK), first_name, last_name, email (UNIQUE), password_hash, phone_number, role, created_at.Dependency Check: All attributes are non-key and directly describe the user_id. There is no non-key attribute determining another non-key attribute (e.g., email does not determine phone_number).Conclusion: In 3NF.B. Property TableAttributes: property_id (PK), host_id (FK), name, description, location, price_per_night, created_at, updated_at.Dependency Check: Attributes like name, description, and price_per_night are directly related to the property_id. The host_id relates the property to its host but does not determine any other non-key attribute within this table.Conclusion: In 3NF.C. Booking TableAttributes: booking_id (PK), property_id (FK), user_id (FK), start_date, end_date, total_price, status, created_at.Dependency Check: total_price is a calculated value based on factors outside the booking's key attributes (like price_per_night from Property and the duration). Crucially, within the Booking table itself, booking_id is the sole determinant. No non-key attribute determines another.Conclusion: In 3NF.D. Payment, Review, and Message TablesThese tables (Payment, Review, Message) are similarly structured, with attributes directly describing their respective primary keys (payment_id, review_id, message_id) and containing foreign keys that correctly link to other entities (booking_id, property_id, sender_id, etc.). There are no transitive dependencies.Conclusion: All tables are in 3NF.
