üì¶ database-script-0x01: AirBnB Database Schema (DDL)This directory contains the initial SQL script (schema.sql) used to define the database structure for the AirBnB clone project, based on the provided entity-relationship (ER) specifications.The schema is designed to model core entities such as Users, Properties, Bookings, Payments, Reviews, and Messages, ensuring Third Normal Form (3NF) compliance.‚öôÔ∏è ContentsFile NameDescriptionschema.sqlContains all the Data Definition Language (DDL) statements (primarily CREATE TABLE commands) required to set up the database structure.‚ú® Schema HighlightsThe schema.sql script ensures data integrity and optimal performance through the following key definitions:Primary and Foreign Keys: All relationships are enforced using Foreign Key (FK) constraints, defining the one-to-many (1:N) and one-to-one (1:1) links between entities.Example: Property.host_id links to User.user_id.Data Types: Appropriate data types are used, including UUID for primary keys, ENUM for fixed-choice fields (e.g., role, status), and DECIMAL for monetary values.Constraints:NOT NULL on all required fields (e.g., first_name, price_per_night).UNIQUE constraint on User.email.CHECK constraint on Review.rating (ensures the value is between 1 and 5).Indexing: Non-primary key columns frequently used in joins or lookups (primarily Foreign Key columns) are explicitly indexed for performance.Examples: idx_property_host_id, idx_booking_property_id.üíæ Execution InstructionsTo set up the database schema (assuming you have a running SQL database like MySQL or PostgreSQL):Connect to your database server using an appropriate client or command-line tool (e.g., psql, mysql).Select or create the target database (e.g., CREATE DATABASE airbnb_db; USE airbnb_db;).Execute the script:Bash# Example for MySQL or PostgreSQL command-line:
# Note: Adjust the database name and user credentials as necessary.
psql -d airbnb_db -f schema.sql
# OR
mysql -u root -p airbnb_db < schema.sql
